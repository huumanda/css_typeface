        <p>To sustain protest we must also turn to one another for support. Can digital media serve as a means for this without undermining it?</p>

        <p>Moderator: Jeremy Antley</p>
        <p>Digitality hasn't obviated geography as was anticipated; it has made geopolitical boundaries simultaneously more visible and more intensely monitored. Sometimes technology even makes visible border practices that states intend to be invisible.</p>
